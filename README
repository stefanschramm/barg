NAME
       barg - create simple ASCII bar graphs from CSV data


SYNOPSIS
       barg [OPTIONS]


DESCRIPTION
       barg  processes  data in CSV format an outputs simple bar graphs as
       ASCII graphics. The option -b COLUMNO specifies which column number
       contains  the  (numerical)  data  used  to draw the bars. barg will
       determine the maximum value of this column and will scale all  bars
       relatively  to  this  maximum.  It is also possible to print a text
       next to each bar with the -l COLUMNO option. In this  case  COLUMNO
       can  be  the  number  of a column, either containing some arbitrary
       string (like a label for this bar) or the same column used for  the
       -b option to print the numeric value. The -b COLUMNO and -l COLUMNO
       options can  be  used  multiple  times  and  the  output  of  these
       labels/bars will be in the order as the options were specified.


OPTIONS
       -b COLUMNO
              use  data from column number COLUMNO (starting at 0) to draw
              a bar


       -l COLUMNO
              use string from column number COLUMNO  (starting  at  0)  to
              print a label


       -f INPUTFILE
              read data from INPUTFILE instead of STDIN


       -d DELIMITER
              use DELIMITER instead of Tab as field delimiter when reading
              data


       -c BARCHAR
              use BARCHAR instead of "|" to draw the bars.  BARCHAR  be  a
              single character.


       -w WIDTH
              Don't  use  automatically determined terminal width to scale
              the graphs but limit the output width to WIDTH characters.
